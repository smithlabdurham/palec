# Tools for Palaeoecological Analysis

This package replicates and enhances some of the functions previously available
in [PAST](https://www.nhm.uio.no/english/research/infrastructure/past/) v2,
some of which are now discontinued.

The tools are intended to provide a straightforward and easy-to-use approach
to palaeoecosystem analysis, providing context for some widely-used metrics to
allow rigorous interpretation.

An introduction to its use, with full installation instructions,
is available as part of my [GEOL2031 teaching materials](https://smithlabdurham.github.io/GEOL2031/2S.html).

## Installing

The pre-release version of the package can be pulled from GitHub using the '[devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools)' package:

    # install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("smithlabdurham/palec")
